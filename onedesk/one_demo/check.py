"""The integration suite: the demo workspace read back as the people in it.

Each check opens what a person would open, as that person, and holds what it
shows against ERPNext's own records: the books balance, stock never went
below nothing, every party is billed in its own currency, every project page
opens for its team and its figures are the documents behind them, every
report of One's runs, and every rail link opens for the app's people.

    bench --site <site> execute onedesk.one_demo.check.run

prints a line a check and the count that failed. Nothing is written: each
check is rolled back.
